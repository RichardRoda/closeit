Provides functional interfaces for using lambda expressions as the target
of a try-with-resources construct.
<p>
Java 7 introduced a useful feature known as the try-with-resources construct.
In order to take advantage of it, a class must implement AutoCloseable.
However, there are classes that could benefit from this interface that do
not implement it.  Two that come to mind are <code>Context</code> and
<code>ExecutorService</code>.  Although <code>AutoCloseable</code> is
a functional interface because it implements exactly 1 abstract method, it is
often not what is needed as a lambda target because its close method throws
<code>Exception</code>.  The CloseIt interfaces provide a series of generic
interfaces that are parameterized with the checked exceptions thrown by
the lambda.  The <code>CloseIt</code> interfaces may be conceptually viewed
as an interface named "CloseIt" followed by a number from 0-5 specifying
how many checked exceptions are specified as generic class arguments.  So, if you
lambda throws no checked exceptions, <code>CloseIt0</code> is used.  If
it throws one checked exception, <code>CloseIt1</code> is used.  Up to five
(<code>CloseIt5</code>) checked exceptions may be supported in this manner.
</p><p>
    <b>Example 1: Close a Context</b><br></p>
<pre><code>
    public void useContext(Context ctx) throws NamingException {
        try(CloseIt1&lt;NamingException&gt; it = ctx::close) {
            doSomethingWithContext(ctx);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    <b>Example 2: Shutdown an ExecutorService</b><br></p>
<pre><code>
    public void useExecutorService() {
        ExecutorService es = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        try(CloseIt0 it = es::shutdown) {
            doSomethingWithExecutorService(es);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>CloseIt0</code> interface has static methods to convert an
<code>AutoClosable</code> using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">decorator pattern</a> 
by either wrapping, consuming, or ignoring exceptions that
occur when the <code>close()</code> method is called.  The <code>CloseIt1</code>
interface has static methods to convert an <code>AutoClosable</code> by
processing (usually wrapping) exceptions that occur from the <code>close()</code>
method into the exception type specified by the <code>CloseIt1</code> interface.
This may be used when the exception type that is desired is a checked exception,
such as a checked application exception.
